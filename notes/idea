Right now if one wants to set their key-bindings they have to go into a
custom game and use the system interface to test and set those bindings.
It would be much better to be able to set these bindings outside of a
custom game, although doing so in a custom allows testing.

Right now if one wants to change their binding setup for the champion
they are using they must wait for the game to start and then change the
bindings during the game. These bindings will save for later games and
require changing back after the game. These binding could take awhile to
change and would have to be changed every time you have custom bindings.
It would be much better to change the settings to pre-configured settings
that have been saved, similar to selecting masteries, runes, item-sets,
etc...
