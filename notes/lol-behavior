Here we will go over all known possibilities for implementing the desired
behavior. Observations of what league does will be recorded for each instance,
these results will be used to determine what will be actually used to implement
lolib.

We know that data regarding input bindings appears in both "input.ini" and
"PersistedSettings.json" within the "Config" directory. What happens to both
the files and the currently set bindings when:

	We change the settings in-game during the game.
		Both "input.ini" and "PersistedSettings.json" are updated
		immediately to the bindings set in-game.
	We restore the default settings during the game.
		Both "input.ini" and "PersistedSettings.json" are updated
		to un-related defaults that appear in-game.
	We change the settings out-of-game during the game.
		The settings in the game do not change, however the settings
		out of game change.
	We start the game with different settings in both files.
		The settings in game take those of "PersistedSettings.json"
		over "input.ini".
	We start the game with no "PersistedSettings.json".
		A "PersistedSettings.json" file is created and takes the
		settings from "input.ini".
	We start the game with no "input.ini".
		File is _not_ created, unless settings are changed in-game.
	We start the game with neither files.
		A "PersistedSettings.json" file is created with no input
		settings. The game uses the default settings. If settings
		are changed in-game, the file has the settings that are
		changed only in the file.

Based off of the above observations there appears to be a few ways of
implementing the desired behavior:

	One can delete the "PersistedSettings.json" file and change the
	"input.ini" file before the game starts.
		The file is generated using any other config files, it
		contains the data from those files, when the game starts
		so deletion is a non-problem.
		"input.ini" appears to be an easier format.

	One can change the "PersistedSettings.json" file before the game
	starts.
		"Editing it is not recommended." Appears in this file, and
		the fact it is automatically generated means alternative
		options should be explored.

Based off of the given, one should delete the "PersistedSettings.json" file
and change the "input.ini" file before the game starts. One can store the
settings in separate "input.ini" files that can be switched and changed or
one can store all of the data in another format.
